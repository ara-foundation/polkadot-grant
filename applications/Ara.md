## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- Lungta is a development model that specifies the entire development lifecycle from idea to release.
- There is no such tool on the Internet where people with ideas can gather together in a public square, form a team, and build a project collectively. Then, after the release, they share the profit on the Internet. Each of these services is isolated but not satisfying to the users. The Lungta model describes the order and necessary tools for making it real in a single place.
- We also plan to release the front end, a web browser. Unlike other web browsers, our browser has an integrated AI Agent and services to achieve the Lungta development model—a web browser with a social network, project management, etc. But it's not part of the Grant, so it's outside of scope.
- The core of Lungta is the tokens and token specifications that describe how the project’s stakeholders and their permissions. Therefore, we want a grant to develop the backend instead of using the web browser. The web interface is out of the scope of this grant request.
- As any project or idea uses components from other works, we must build a necessary licensing mechanism that allows users to use other works in their projects. The profit is distributed to all stakeholders, including the component’s authors, whenever a project generates revenue.
- Consider the current state of open-source projects as an example. Any modern software depends on other software. Whenever I build a profitable project, no mechanism will distribute part of our money to open-source projects. I earn from free software, while they don’t get anything back.
- Take the game industry as an example. Any successful game that attracts more than a million users will have a community-made mod. But turning the mods into a profitable game failed. All attempts by major game corporations such as Bethesda and Valve to monetize user-made mods failed.
With this licensing mechanism, whenever I see a game and modify/resell it, 10% of my revenue will automatically be distributed to the original game author.
- We call this licensing mechanism a Hyperpayment. And our Lungta’s implementation will have a token issue and an implementation of the hyperpayment model. We want to make it through the Substrate as part of the Polkadot family.


### Project Details

We started with the very ambitious idea of changing the entire world. As we began implementation, we realized that it takes lots of time and effort from the community. Therefore, we narrowed it down to the smaller steps and continued to expand it to the final form:

Our end goal is program synthesis: “When a computer does whatever a user wants.” But as technology is still far from reaching this goal, we started by integrating developers and ordinary internet users.

- [Hyperpayment protocol specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d3TgpcZGwnmzO3SXthvqX_hG5cji6Yj3oZUMvrwDm08/edit?usp=sharing)
- [A variant of hyperpayment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SpYRn30p_mJn_n4Le0mYinui_uJ8OQr1ggVlDUQAbno/edit?usp=sharing) that we want to implement with the Substrate. Each domain (music, art, game etc) will have its hyperpayment. Our hyperpayment defines how the software owners distribute the profit to the open-source libraries.
- We already have real clients in our MVP and users who are testing it. 
Our Lungta Model MVP: https://forum.ara.foundation/ .
- A launchpad MVP as part of Lungta Model where projects get the real money as MVP: https://maydone.ara.foundation 
- MVP of the project management (for now, we use Trello): https://trello.com/w/arafoundation/home 
- MVP of project's token management per milestones: https://token.ara.foundation/ 
- A blockchain simulator as the MVP; the transactions we will have are outlined on the blockchain simulator: https://github.com/ara-foundation/blockchain-simulator 
- A smartcontracts (which are less efficient to implement the Lungta model, but to kick start with some clients we already launched it) https://github.com/ara-foundation/smartcontracts 
- A comprehensive research with 200 materials. Our Whitepaper is the summary of the study: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVN1CP7ck=/ (about 200 links, lectures, books, articles, and software)

  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and clarify any limitations that might not be obvious


### Ecosystem Fit

As I researched the Polkadot, I couldn’t think of similar projects. The closest project (even the same Logo as ours, but we didn’t know it until the end) is https://www.common.xyz/ 

Our Lungta Model defines five steps from the idea to the project release. Communities can use each step independently. As we create the blockchain specifically for project development transparency, any Grants or forums, including this proposal or Polkadot Forum, can use it as their backend.

As the concern of any granter, the community is trust; our project aims to bring it between online users. I hope you and other grant issuers will use our blockchain to govern the sponsorship of the next big hits of the Web 3 world.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that fu nctionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We *recommend* that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables are based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish *under the terms of the license* of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Projects that submit other people's work without proper attribution will be immediately terminated.**
